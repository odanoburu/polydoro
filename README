* polydoro: simple and customizable pomodoro timer

=polydoro= has two design goals: being simple so that you can read and
understand the code in a few minutes without much concentration; and
being customizable so that you can adapt it to your needs.

These two goals imply that this package is not meant to be used before
some configuration. We do try to provide sensible defaults, but it is
best if you customize at least how you are notified of the running out
of a timer.

We encourage you to run =M-x customize-group RET polydoro= as soon as
you install the package for the first time, or you may adapt the
following [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] declaration for your needs:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

#+END_SRC

** Naming

=polydoro= is a portmanteau of polymorphic and pomodoro. The idea is
that =polydoro= is polymorphic because of the many forms it can take
depending on user configuration. (=Polydoro/Polydorus= is also a Greek
name, but I don't really recall all the myth characters with that
name.)


** Troubleshooting

make sure your font supports the unicode characters =üçÖ (TOMATO
codepoint 127813)= and =‚è≤ (TIMER CLOCK codepoint 9202)= if you want to
use the default lighters.
